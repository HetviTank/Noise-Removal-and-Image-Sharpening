# Image Processing with Pillow, NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib

## Overview

This project focuses on image processing using Python libraries such as Pillow (PIL), NumPy, OpenCV (cv2), and Matplotlib. The primary objective is to demonstrate the process of converting a blurred image to a clear one by applying various image processing techniques.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.10
- Pillow (PIL)
- NumPy
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following:

```bash
pip install pillow numpy opencv-python matplotlib
